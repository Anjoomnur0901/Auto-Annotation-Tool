# Auto-Annotation Tool for Brain Tumor

This annotation tool is designed to facilitate the preparation of images for segmentation tasks, specifically focusing on brain tumors. Built using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) from the Ultralytics package, this tool automates the annotation process, eliminating the need for manual labeling.

## Key Components

### SAM Model
- The SAM model from the Ultralytics package is at the core of this tool, leveraging its robust capabilities in image segmentation.
- The model is fine-tuned for the specific task of detecting and annotating brain tumors in medical images.

### Pre-Trained Image Detection Model
- A pre-trained image detection model is used to provide a strong starting point for the annotation process.
- This model's weights and architecture are optimized to identify brain tumors accurately, enabling precise annotation.

### Annotation Process
- The tool takes raw medical images as input and processes them using the SAM model.
- The model generates segmentation masks, creating annotation files that highlight the areas of interest, such as brain tumors, within the images.

### Efficiency and Accuracy
- The automated approach significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual annotation.
- By utilizing a pre-trained model, the tool ensures high accuracy in the generated annotations, aiding in reliable segmentation.

## Applications
- This tool can be integrated into medical imaging workflows, assisting radiologists and researchers in quickly preparing large datasets for further analysis.
- It is particularly useful in creating training datasets for machine learning models aimed at brain tumor detection and segmentation.

By leveraging the SAM model from Ultralytics and a pre-trained image detection model, this auto-annotation tool streamlines the preparation of medical images for segmentation, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in brain tumor research and diagnosis.
